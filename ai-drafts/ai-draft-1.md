**Project Summary**

Title: "Educational Robotics as a Scalable Data Collection Pipeline for Foundation Models"

Overview:
This project addresses a critical challenge in robotics research: the scarcity of high-quality human demonstration data for training foundation models. We propose a novel approach that leverages an established educational robotics program to create a sustainable pipeline for robotic data collection while simultaneously advancing STEM education. By combining revenue-generating educational activities with research infrastructure development, we create a financially sustainable model that bridges the gap between robotics education and cutting-edge AI research.

Intellectual Merit:
- Novel framework for collecting diverse human-robot interaction data through structured educational programs
- Development of quality control methodologies for student-generated demonstration data
- Research into how educational interactions can inform foundation model development
- Investigation of curriculum design that optimizes both learning outcomes and data quality
- Integration of latest foundation model architectures (like Ï€0) with educational robotics

Broader Impacts:
- Creates sustainable pipeline for robotics education and research data collection
- Makes robotics education more accessible through revenue-generating program structure
- Develops open-source tools for robotic data collection and validation
- Establishes replicable model for combining education and research in robotics
- Advances understanding of how humans learn and teach robotic systems

Budget Efficiency:
The project leverages an existing educational program generating approximately $700,000 annually in operational funding. The requested NSF funding ($545,000 over three years) focuses specifically on research infrastructure and data collection capabilities, demonstrating significant cost-sharing and long-term sustainability.

Research Plan:
1. Development of data collection infrastructure integrated with educational robotics curriculum
2. Implementation of quality control systems for student-generated data
3. Creation of assessment tools measuring both educational outcomes and data quality
4. Integration of collected data with foundation model training pipelines
5. Validation through real-world robotic tasks

Let me analyze how our project aligns with the key requirements from the M3X grant program.

**1. Human and Synthetic Actors**
- Required: Must involve interaction between human and synthetic actors with sensorimotor capabilities
- Our Alignment:
  * Students (human actors) directly interact with robot arms (synthetic actors)
  * Teaching process naturally creates rich interaction data
  * Both actors engage in physical manipulation tasks
  * Multiple types of robots provide diverse interaction scenarios

**2. Sensorimotor Interaction**
- Required: Must have bidirectional exchange through sensorimotor channels
