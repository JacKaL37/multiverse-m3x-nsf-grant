Assumptions

    Cohort Size:
    Each cohort consists of 30 students.

    There are 3 cohorts in a year, totaling 90 students.

    Prerequisites:
    1/3 of students take no prerequisites.
    1/3 of students take a single prerequisite (Code, costing $500).
    1/3 of students take two prerequisites (Code and one additional prerequisite like Prompt Engineering, totaling $1,500).
    Total prerequisite revenue for each cohort:
        ( \frac{30}{3} \times 0 + \frac{30}{3} \times 500 + \frac{30}{3} \times 1500 = $20,000 )

    The Multiverse School captures this as revenue and uses it as initial bootstrapping cash, and for paying professors to get enough "robot-ready" learners together to stock the program.

    Class Progression:
    Every student completes classes up to 301:
        101: $240 per student.
        201: $5,000 per student.
        301: $3,000 per student.
    Total revenue per student: ( 240 + 5000 + 3000 = $8,240 ).

    Each class will take a few weeks to teach, and there's a timing / rooms / physical equipment / professors problem here, (let Liz worry about it it's their bread and butter)

    Revenue per Cohort:
    101 revenue: ( 30 \times 240 = $7,200 ).
    201 revenue: ( 30 \times 5000 = $150,000 ).
    301 revenue: ( 30 \times 3000 = $90,000 ).

    Total revenue for a 30-person cohort: $247,290

    Total Revenue:
    Adding prerequisite revenue and class progression revenue across all cohorts (3) yields $741,600, with prerequisites yields $801,600 annually.

Robotics Program:
101

    Build a Rover
        Joaquin and I are running this 1st week of December in SF as a prototype
        parts list
        Roughly costs $31 per person just on amazon
    Robot Control
        Set up server for controlling robot
    $240 for the whole series (performing pricing and pacing)

201

    Build a Robot Arm (SO-100)
        Entry Level
        3 sessions
    How to set up teleoperation
        Simple, one session after building the arm
    Train an action policy on the SO-100 (3 weeks)
    $5000 (1k/week) (needs pricing and pacing research)

301

    How to use types of robot arms that we got
        Worth $, Immediate job skill
    $3000? Needs pricing research, this is a gut call

401 - Research Program

    Train an action policy on the arms?
        for researchers, not so difficult, but physically dangeroussd
    How to set up a multi-step assembly process
        Worth $ but would probably need a more in-depth program for certs
    How to set up a sorting process
        Technical Risk? A Fast Follow on Covariant

Robotics Prerequisites

Some of the prerequisites (we can also teach these & have pricing and pacing on them), but also, crucially, feeder audiences who can often pay well for classes.

The Multiverse School can capture a lot of the Customer LifeTime Value (LTV) of a student who doesn't have some baseline readiness for a robotics program (at least one of the below, or hardware engineers can cross-pollenate)

    Code - 12 - 24 sessions
        $500-$3000 per student
    ML - 12 - 24 sessions
        $2000 - $5000 per student
    Prompt Engineering - 12 sessions
        $1200 per student
    Agent Engineering - 12 sessions
        $3000 - per student with robotics as a next step
    Data & Cloud Engineering - 12 sessions
        $3000 - per student

Professors

Who have confirmed they want in & posess the skills needed to meaningfully contribute

    Joaquin - Robots and CS (may or may not want to quit his job but would like to)
    Liz Howard (AI Liz) - Programs, CS, ML, RL, Robot Arms
    Liz Cheverra (Battlebots Liz) - Programs, Robot Arms, Fab, Battlebots
    JKL - CS, ML, Robots, CogSci
    Chris - Part Time while learning, is teaching, has other LOB
    Ryan - Programs, Biznaz, CS, ML, RL, Robot Arms (Part Time), CogSci/Neuro

Resources We Have For Sure:

    Robot Arms
    An Apartment Building That Needs Work To Be Inhabitable But Could Help
    A Factory To Host Classes and Robot Arms
    Humans and Brains
    An Audience
    Servers & 2080s
    SFCompute

Resources We Might Need:

    More Compute (probably get from SFCompute)

Program Costs - Idealized
Cost Parameters

    The Professors Need To Get Paid (everyone participating)
        10k a month (120/yr) for Full Time
        3k a month (36k / yr) for Part Time
    Andy probably should get compensated for the space (to support detroit nonprofits this will be an easy sell)
        ??? I dont know how much really.
        Let's Guess $5k / mo but obviously this can go up
    Maybe some physical equipment we're missing (say 30k-50k?)
    What Am I Missing?

Staff Costs:

    4 FT * 120k = 420k / yr
        3 professors at a time
        1 program person
    3 PT * 3k/mo = 36k / yr = 108k
    5k/mo for Andy / DBC = 60k / yr ??? this can swing 100k+ bro idk plz tell me what you need and how to make this make sense for you

1 year = 588
2 years = 1.1m

    Robot Arms (1m) (handled)

    Equipment (40k)

    30% over what we need is 360000
